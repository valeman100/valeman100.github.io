Finally last week OpenAI released the APIs to finetune the popular model on which ChatGPT is based!

Following [their suggestions](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_finetune_chat_models.ipynb) we will go through step by step from the dataset preparation to the tuned model usage.

Until a few months ago finetuning a general model was not a straightforward task, it involved knowledge in training, ML frameworks, and the availability of computational units like GPUs.
Lately, things are becoming easier thanks to people's open source projects which already implement the heavy parts for you.

OpenAI gives you the chance to train your LLM even if you don't know anything about the subject, you'll just need a bit of Python and an OpenAI account.

##### What we will cover:
- When and why adopt finetune
- Dataset preparation
- Finetune
- Validation
