## ChatGPT write my CV, please

I think this is the most delicate point and where most of the people don't really take advantage of the real power of large language models (LLM). I mean the importance of writing a well structured and efficace prompt is the killer feature to taylor the best responce of our friends LLMs.
This is so important that in the last months the professional figure of the prompt engeneer has rose, and is also very well retribuited.

Here I'll give you for free the prompt I have elaborated with a few of trials and at the best of my knowledge performs as desired.

# Section: Presentation:
The first thing I learned was that in front of a microphone, you shouldn't force the pronunciation of the 'P'.
A sweet, delicate, mild sound must come out. So I discovered that not only colors but also words have their fascinating nuances.
Anything else about me? I believe in symmetry, listening, and Agatha Christie's pen: eyes, ears, and brain need order.
