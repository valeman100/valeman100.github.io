## ChatGPT write my CV, please

I think this is the most delicate point and where most of the people don't really take advantage of the real power of large language models (LLM). I mean the importance of writing a well structured and efficace prompt is the killer feature to taylor the best responce of our friends LLMs.
This is so important that in the last months the professional figure of the prompt engeneer has rose, and is also very well retribuited.

Here I'll give you for free the prompt I have elaborated with a few of trials and at the best of my knowledge performs as desired.

Personally I have a bunch of experience in CV structuring but to give you an eaven better product I followed the instructions of a well experienced HR [Fabian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiana-andreani/), with which I had the pleasure to share an online experience as a speaker.

Hi, ChatGPT today you will be my personal assistant for the creation of my first CV.
I want a CV written in latex that follows these stylistic characteristics:
# documentclass moderncv classic and the light blue color
# page margins scaled to 0.75
# profile picture
# The profile picture must align with the following contact information:

Mario Rossi,
mario.rossi@gmail.com,
+393293385789,
Milan

# Section: Presentation:
The first thing I learned was that in front of a microphone, you shouldn't force the pronunciation of the 'P'.
A sweet, delicate, mild sound must come out. So I discovered that not only colors but also words have their fascinating nuances.
Anything else about me? I believe in symmetry, listening, and Agatha Christie's pen: eyes, ears, and brain need order.

Let me comment this prompt and unveil some tricks.
You should set up a complex prompt always with this three pice of information:

- Initial part where tyou explaint to the model the task in the most accurate and direct way possible
- one or more examples of the task 
- the use of structures familiar to the model, i.e. use symbols like # or - to underline commands or lists of elements and new lines to separate different pieces of information. 

In the prompt we can clearly see the assertive direct initial command to create a CV in Latex, the use of symbles to divide the different sections and an exemple of the CV structure we are interested to create.

Wait for ChatGPT generation than copy the code it generate and move to the next paragraph.

ps. The initial Hi, ChatGPT' is useless, it just give a human like flavour.

## Adjust and Compile

It's time to compile the code we just recived but first let me give you a brief grasp on what is Latex.

[Latex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a software system for document preparation and the best think is that you don't have to know the language and will be very intuitive what to modify in order to obtain our best PDF.

First of all we need to compile the code, [overleaf](https://it.overleaf.com/) is the best free online option. Register on the site and create a new document clicking on the top left button. Past the model code in the left column and push the recompile button.
Now you should see something similar to this:

<div class="img-div-any-width" markdown="0">
  <img src="/images/reading_robot.png" />
</div>

WHat i want to give you heare are the basics intuitions on how the Latex code works and what to change.

ChatGPT generation should start with 

```text
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,sans]{moderncv}
\moderncvstyle{classic}
\moderncvcolor{blue}
\usepackage[scale=0.75]{geometry}
```

Those are basicalli the commands that sets the style of the page. It has a basic caracter of 11pt, the sans typing style, moderncv class with a classic pagination and the color of the preimposted elements in blue. Lat one is a scale factor to reduce the margin grandezza.

From now on starts more human info in oarticular our infos

```text
\name{Mario}{Rossi}
\title{CV}
\address{Milan}
\phone{+393293385789}
\email{mario.rossi@gmail.com}
\photo[64pt][0.4pt]{profile_picture.jpg}
```

As you can clearly see changing your contacts is as easy as editing the elemnts in curly brackets. For Example instead of CV as title we could write the title of the position we want to apply for.
Heare is also the place where we are going to insert the profile picture. To load our pic we can click on the top left icon (the one with an up arrow) above the main.tex writing and select from our local machine the image. Than change the name in the brackets of \photo marker. Recompile and you will see a new generated PDF with your beautiful face on top.

The other elements are also pretty simple, are devided in sections and each sections contains some markers. The first we meet is 

```text
\cventry{2019--2021}{Master's Degree in Public and Corporate Communication}{University of Milan "La Statale"}{}{}{Add description here.}
```

The first element is what will go under the blue line, the secon is the bold writing the second will be aligned with the previous but with normal font and the last can contain a description located under the bold title.

With those pieces of information you shold be fully autonomous in customize your CV.
when the result sudisfy your needs recompile and download the document pushing the button with a down arrow near the compile green one.

## Final Thoughts

Here we are in less than five minuts we created a professional stunning CV fully custumizzable.

My suggestion is always to experiment in the sense that if you want to add or modify something in latex and you can't figure out a H from where to start, well simply ask to Chatgpt (try to ask for example where can I put a linkedin profile on my CV?)

Past days I ingegnerized the prompt as much as possible to reach a sactisfactory result form me but experiment even with it and see for example what happen if you losen the constreint on the initial 'moderncv' document class and see if ChatGPT can change the style for you .

I hope you have found this guide helpful.
