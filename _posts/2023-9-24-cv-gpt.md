## ChatGPT write my CV, please

I think this is the most delicate point and where most people don't take advantage of the real power of large language models (LLM). I mean the importance of writing a well-structured and effective prompt is the killer feature to tailor the best response of our friends LLMs.
This is so important that in the last months, the professional figure of the prompt engineer has risen, and is also very well remunerated.

Here I'll give you for free the prompt I have elaborated with a few trials and to the best of my knowledge performs as desired.

I have a bunch of experience in CV structuring but to give you an even better product I followed the instructions of a well-experienced HR [Fabian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiana-andreani/), with whom I had the pleasure to share an online experience as a speaker.

Hi, ChatGPT today you will be my personal assistant for the creation of my first CV.
I want a CV written in latex that follows these stylistic characteristics:
# documentclass moderncv classic and the light blue color
# page margins scaled to 0.75
# profile picture
# The profile picture must align with the following contact information:

Mario Rossi,
mario.rossi@gmail.com,
+393293385789,
Milan

# Section: Presentation:
The first thing I learned was that in front of a microphone, you shouldn't force the pronunciation of the 'P'.
A sweet, delicate, mild sound must come out. So I discovered that not only colors but also words have their fascinating nuances.
Anything else about me? I believe in symmetry, listening, and Agatha Christie's pen: eyes, ears, and brain need order.

Let me comment on this prompt and unveil some tricks.
You should set up a complex prompt always with these three pieces of information:

- Initial part where you explain to the model the task most accurately and directly as possible
- one or more examples of the task 
- the use of structures familiar to the model, i.e. use symbols like # or - to underline commands or lists of elements and new lines to separate different pieces of information. 

In the prompt, we can see the assertive direct initial command to create a CV in Latex, the use of symbols to divide the different sections, and an example of the CV structure we are interested in creating.

Wait for ChatGPT generation then copy the code it generates and move to the next paragraph.

ps. The initial Hi, ChatGPT' is useless, it just gives a human-like flavor.

## Adjust and Compile

It's time to compile the code we just received but first let me give you a brief grasp on what is Latex.

[Latex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a software system for document preparation and the best thing is that you don't have to know the language and will be very intuitive about what to modify to obtain our best PDF.

First of all, we need to compile the code, [overleaf](https://it.overleaf.com/) is the best free online option. Register on the site and create a new document by clicking on the top left button. Past the model code in the left column and push the recompile button.
Now you should see something similar to this:

<div class="img-div-any-width" markdown="0">
  <img src="/images/reading_robot.png" />
</div>

What I want to give you here are the basic intuitions on how the Latex code works and what to change.

ChatGPT generation should start with 

```text
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,sans]{moderncv}
\moderncvstyle{classic}
\moderncvcolor{blue}
\usepackage[scale=0.75]{geometry}
```

Those are the commands that set the style of the page. It has a basic font size of 11pt, a sans typing style, moderncv class with classic pagination, and the color of the preset elements in blue. The latest one is a scale factor to reduce the margin width.

From now on start more human-like elements in particular our info

```text
\name{Mario}{Rossi}
\title{CV}
\address{Milan}
\phone{+393293385789}
\email{mario.rossi@gmail.com}
\photo[64pt][0.4pt]{profile_picture.jpg}
```

As you can see changing your contacts is as easy as editing the elements in curly brackets. For example, instead of a CV as a title, we could write the title of the position we want to apply for.
Here is also the place where we are going to insert the profile picture. To load our pic we can click on the top left icon (the one with an up arrow) above the main.tex writing and select from our local machine the image. Then change the name in the brackets of \photo marker. Recompile and you will see a newly generated PDF with your beautiful face on top.

The other elements are also pretty simple, are divided into sections and each section contains some markers. The first we meet is 

```text
\cventry{2019--2021}{Master's Degree in Public and Corporate Communication}{University of Milan "La Statale"}{}{}{Add description here.}
```

The first element is what will go under the blue line, the second is the bold writing the second will be aligned with the previous but with normal font, and the last can contain a description located under the bold title.

With those pieces of information, you should be fully autonomous in customizing your CV.
When the result satisfies your needs recompile and download the document by pushing the button with a down arrow near the compile green one.

## Final Thoughts

Here we are in less than five minutes we created a professional stunning CV fully customizable.

My suggestion is always to experiment in the sense that if you want to add or modify something in latex and you can't figure out an H from where to start, well simply ask to Chatgpt (try to ask for example where can I put a LinkedIn profile on my CV?)

Past few days I engineered the prompt as much as possible to reach a satisfactory result for me but experiment with it and see for example what happens if you loosen the constreint on the initial 'moderncv' document class and see if ChatGPT can change the style for you.

I hope you have found this guide helpful.
